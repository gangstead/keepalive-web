# Keepalive-web
Front end for [keepalive-service](https://github.com/gangstead/keepalive-service)

# Developing

```sh
> npm install -g node-pre-gyp  (first time only)
> npm install
> npm start
```

This should start the server and open a tab in your browser to http://localhost:3000 with the application running.  This should also reload as you save files.

I started this project with [angular-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular-starter) because it appears to have everything you could ever want already set up:
> An Angular starter kit featuring [Angular 4](https://angular.io), [Ahead of Time Compile](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html), [Router](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html), [Forms](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html),

Therefor if you see something in here that doesn't appear to be used or doesn't make sense it's because I either don't know how to use it or haven't taken it out yet.  Make an issue and I'll look into it.
